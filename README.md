# MachineLearning
This repository will be home to some basic ML code, as I learn how machine learning works and how it is implemented.
A large amount of this code will come from tutorials, and hence many of the concept are not mine - credit will be given when possible.

# Current Examples & Programs
### Car Classifier
Uses a tree classifier to determine what category a car belongs in from the Top Speed and Acceleration. 

### Iris Data Set Classifier
Uses a tree classifier to determine what species a flower is from various measurments using the Iris Data Set.

### Addition
Algorithm learns how to perform addition through supervised learning, eg. features of the 2 values and a result of its sum.

### Car Price Estimator
Estminates the price of a car from its Top Speed and Acceleration.
